# WorkAgenda
  ## Description
   - Created  an Agenda for a work day to help organize a schedule.
   - This app will help maintain the users schedule throught out their work day. Allows the user to be able to type in memos in different hours wether current or later. It is color coded to give it a better visual understanding for the users.
   - I learned how to incorporate moment.js.
